      <h3>Specifications:</h3>
      <p>A robotic vacuum cleaner, often called a robovac, is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner which has intelligent programming and a limited vacuum cleaning system. The original design included manual operation via remote control and a "self-drive" mode which allowed the machine to clean autonomously without human control. Some designs use spinning brushes to reach tight corners. Others include a number of cleaning features (mopping, UV sterilization, etc.) along with the vacuuming.</p>
